				<h2>When you don’t need a screening:</h2>
				<p>If you met all four targets in 2013, you don't have to get a screening in 2014 to have a plan choice or get the full incentive for 2015.  You're already done!</p>
				<p><span>Note:</span> If you used the Reasonable Alternative Standard (RAS) option or submitted a Reasonable Accommodation (RA) form to meet all four targets in 2013, you still have to complete a screening in 2014 by September 30.</p>

				<h2>Real money for meeting screening targets</h2>
				<p>You earn $100 for each screening target you meet – up to $400 dollars if you are enrolled in an Anthem medical plan in 2015. If your spouse/domestic partner meets the targets too, you get double the money. Remember, you also get $50 for each target you improve from 2013. Go to the Health page when you’ve completed your screening to see incentives you’ve earned.</p>

				<h2>Screening targets will be the same</h2>
				<p>Our targets aren’t changing for 2014, and you can go to the Health page to see your past screening results. Any screenings you receive between January 1, 2014 and September 30, 2014 will count for your 2015 plan choice and incentive funding.</p>

				<h2>Four ways to get screened:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><span>Your doctor's office</span> – download the new 2014-2015 PCP form and take it to your screening appointment with your medical ID card.  You must return the form by September 30, 2014.</li>
					<li><span>A Kroger Co. Pharmacy</span> – call 1-877-444-9689 or go to <a href="http://krogerscreenings.com" target="_blank">krogerscreenings.com</a> for an appointment.</li>
					<li><span>The Little Clinic</span> – go to <a href="http://www.thelittleclinic.com" target="_blank">thelittleclinic.com</a> for locations – no appointment necessary.</li>
					<li><span>Company-sponsored screening event</span> – see postings at your worksite location.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Tips for screening:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Schedule the first screening appointment of the day.</li>
					<li>Fast 12 hours prior to the screening (water and medications are ok).</li>
